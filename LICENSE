🚀 About Next Gen Developers (NGD)
Next Gen Developers (NGD) is a global, student-powered tech movement founded to empower learners through real-world coding, open-source collaboration, and purpose-driven innovation. We believe that students don’t just need tutorials—they need opportunities to build, contribute, and lead.

NGD projects are designed to be:

Technically enriching: Hands-on, scalable, and rooted in real-world relevance.

Aesthetically resonant: Beautifully branded, emotionally engaging, and creatively named.

Ethically grounded: Built with transparency, inclusivity, and global accessibility in mind.

This software is part of NGD’s mission to make open-source development a gateway to growth—for students, educators, and innovators around the world. Whether you're using this code to learn, teach, or build something new, you're contributing to a movement that values creativity, collaboration, and impact.
